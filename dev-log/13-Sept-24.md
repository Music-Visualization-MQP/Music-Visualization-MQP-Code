# Dev Log 3

## 13 Sept 2024

### Docker

* docker is one of those tools that is your greatest enemy and your best friend at the same time
  * part of me kind of hates it at this time because I feel like its the same old "write once run anywhere" nonsense
  * each environment is going to take some ammount of time to setup, I think the best solution is to try and cut down on the number of env files/ create a script for making them, we guard it with our lives lul
  * getting it up on a mac was pretty easy actually so me bitching about docker not working on mac was just me being daft

### Testing

* supabase cli makes testing really easy, and I think it is easily automatable with a simole script, (have to talk to the team about this one)
  * i think that supabase wants people to use the cli for testing and then deploy so yeah, also whats with no import map.json, i saw something about deno.json

### WINDOWS 

* working across 2 different os's is a total pita
  * especially when the person supporting 1 os is using the other os

# Dev Log 2

## 11 Sept 2024

### Docker

The dockerization of the project has begun!
* frontend is dockerized, with a few stages
  * dev
    * uses ng serve to serve a dev environment, currently bound to 0.0.0.0 which meanse that the dev environment is accessable from anywhere with direct access to wpi network
    * when trying to get angular to serve to the correct host you must tell it to bind to 0.0.0.0, through commandline arguments or else you just wont beable to access it, im sure there are easier better ways to do it but this works for nwo
  * prod
    * skeleton nginx project that does not fully function, yet
* multiple docker images
  * instead of trying to combine all the docker compose images into one megga image, you can just invoke them all at once, seems optimal because at most there will be 4 docker compose files
    * dev for frontend and data acquistion
    * prod for frontend and data acquisition
    * musicbrainz
    * supabase


### misc

* I added a self hosted runner to the frontend, so hopefully once we have a robust cicd plan in-place we should be able to use github actions to automagically deploy the frontend

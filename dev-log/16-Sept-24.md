# Dev Log 4

## 13 Sept 2024

### Docker

* dockerization is mostly complete, however id like to figure out how tp make testing part of the workflow, me and mich might work on that
* once i figured out how to correctly find the url for supabase, http://kong:9000 things got easier, the reason that localhost:9000 wouldnt work is unlike the frontend which is run on the client, data acquisiton is run in docker so it can use docker dns to resolve requests? (check wording)
* watch is also very useful, which allows live code updates, god i would have loved to know about that yesterday lol

### Supporting windows devs

* im convinced that microsoft wants to make scripting a total hastle because devs are bad at using the shift key at least this one is
  * for example in a unix-like environment to create a file with given content and overwrite if it exists is `echo "lala" > file.txt` just take this piss, it into that, PERFECT
  * in powershell to do the same you run `New-Item -Path $PWD\ "file.txt" -ItemType "File" -Value "lala"` WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT its 3 times longer and i HATE it
    * i did eventually get it working but its just not as clean and easy as the bash variant
      * well it runs under zsh on mac so whatever the shell script

### Data acquisition

* I really want to get rolling on the revamp of data acquisitipn, that way we can start writing more tests and the new way of doing things is just sooooo much more reasonable

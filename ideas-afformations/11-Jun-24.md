# Ideas and Afformations

## 11 Jun 24

### Utopia Platform Goals and notes

* scan a barcode on a cd, record, or tape and select the songs you played
* live update as you listen to tracks on various platforms
* switch the album art reference for a specific release and have that information store for any given user
* simulate wear and tear on the cover of music the more a user listens to a specific album
* Implement a load balancer
* native apps for ios and android, not using flutter or something like that
* the "cloud" of album art should appear natural without obvious rank, there should be some weighting though, which keeps the largest albums near the center
* clicking on an album should present a few views mainly statistics related to that album
* the frontend code is hacked together, id like to get it to the point where it is not
  * this is obvious by running `ng test` horrifying...
  * there should be no access to the profile components before a user authorizes
* Add realtime functionality, view current playing track and watch that album add to the collage
* the way musicbrainz works now is also pretty hacky and could be much better... I also need to get the tests passing, even though the endpoints act as i expect. Its failing because my test data already exists in the database 
* 



### Afformations

* **Collaboration**
  * An appropreate slack channel should be created for each sub-project
  * the group will decide the final platform for communication, slack, discord, etc.
  * the group will also agree on a general meeting format (virtual/ in-person)
    * if online is chosen any in person meetings will need to be joinable for those not present
* **Infastructure**
  * there must be simplicity, I want the least amount of time to be spent organizing infastructure, whether that's my computer running 24/7 with group members all having ssh/whatever or using supabase's own platform or aws, the possibilities are endless
  * code should be as portable as possible
  * there should be a docker compose file which allows the entire service to be spun up with one command
  * 
* **procedure**
  * we as a group should define procedures for integrating new ideas and features
  * the group should agree on what constitutes complete at the begining of a subproject
  * features should be completed before moving on to the next step
  * 

* **features**
  * users might be able to upload more information like the cd booklet in that case the media should be shared
    * there might be a verification process
  * the service should support spotify and itunes (old school using an exportable xml)
  * 

* **requirements**
  * all artwork should be unaltered and should display as it would in real life, ie no alterations to the aspect ratio and no effects such as an inner shadow
  * images should be preloaded before the home page is shown to the user
  *

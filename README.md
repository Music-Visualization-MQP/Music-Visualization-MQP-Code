Again... I am not sure if this is the right way to do this....

the way i thought through this though was to have a git repository for the main docker containers where they could all be built and deployed from the same convinent repo with submodules for the other repos

this, like everything is subject to change

so many security vulnerabilities,

so many reasons for the apps to fail to communicate
